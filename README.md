# Calculator

## Description of the Project

In this project I had to build a calculator able to perform simple mathematic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). As Extra Points for this project I also had to implement operations with decimal numbers, Make all the project looking nice and also add a keybord support. A must of the project is to implement a function that takes 2 numbers and an operator and return the result of the operation, using the result as the first number of the next operation.

## Struggles Points

The biggest struggle of the project was the use of all the variables.It was hard to figure out the logic behind the variables assignment and don't get confused with which to use in the operation, which one was just for storing and calling them again when using the functions.

Another crucial point was try to predict unexpected input from the user and for example don't crush the app when pressing two times the operator sign or 2 times the dot for decimals numbers.

A still unsolved problem is to limit the number of input to don't overflow the content of the display out of the div. I've tried with preventDefault() and removeEventListener but both of them didn't work.

## Conclusion
At the end this was a very interesting project for a beginner of Javascript which help me a lot to understand better the logic behind the Events in Javascript, how to manipulate the DOM, to play around with CSS and at the end I'm happy with what I achieved, considering my knowledge before starting this project.
